Poem 1:
You laugh, you cry, you dream, you whine
 You seem almost real
Am I insane?
You sound the part and feel the part
You just don't look the part
Either way, for now I think the color pink
Fits you best

Poem 2:
as a child my mother once found me scraping my
shadow from the pavement
he'll be my best friend - she said to me
in the dark when the creatures emerge he has long
abandoned me

Poem 3:
Still I hear that bell of death
Behind me crowing every morning.
Its is the message that's known.
That's the alarm that's always mourning,
The doves between the branches sown.

Poem 4:
A raw, thumping ache is for sure
To find problems is my solution
Causes for all back then
Or now
Stained lips, sweet or red, maybe nothing
It's my fault or theirs

Poem 5:
True love watches the city skyline
Admiring from bedside
True love hides under the morning covers
Begging for one more hour of rest
True love waits meek and vulnerable

Poem 6:
"Individuality."
The soldier had it engraved upon his attire.
Flying saucers whizzed past his star-speckled hair.
"Glory for Rome!" He declared
as the fifth wall imploded.
You stared in panic
when our worlds merged together
